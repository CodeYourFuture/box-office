# Box office - junior technical test

The purpose of this technical interview is to assess your problem-solving ability,your technical communication and your ability to write clear well structured code.

## The Task

### Duration ‚è∞ 1 hour max

![React Component](./assets/react-component.jpg)

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Shows should be displayed on three columns for desktop screens
- [ ] Each show card should include the show image, title and click through to the correct booking link
- [ ] "SOLD OUT" shows should be greyed out with a label of "SOLD OUT" in place of the "BOOK NOW" button. You should also **not** be able to click on these tiles
- [ ] Show tiles on the same row should all be equal height

## Endpoints

### List all showings

The `/api/shows/all-open` endpoint serves an array of shows objects. On each object you will find a `see_tickets_url_infos` property that stores an array of booking links. If this array is empty, then that show should appear as "SOLD OUT". If there are items in the array, then you should pick the url with a subdomain of `tktsonline.seetickets.com` as the booking link and if that is not available fallback to using the `officiallondontheatre.seetickets.com` url.
